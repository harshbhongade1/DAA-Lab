/*Problem Description:

Given the weights and values of N objects, place them in a bag with a capacity of W to calculate the bag's maximum possible total value. To put it another way, given are two integer arrays, val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1], which, respectively, represent values and weights connected to N items.



Additionally, given an integer W that represents the capacity of a knapsack, determine the largest value subset of val[] such that the total of its weights is less than or equal to W. An item cannot be broken; you must either pick it in its entirety or not at all (0-1 property).



Note: Please take a note that we only have one quantity of each item.



Constraints:

 ≤ N, W ≤ 

 ≤ val[i], wt[i] ≤ 



Input Format:

The first line represents the size of both the arrays N.
The second line represents the set of elements of val[ ].
The third line represents the set of elements of wt[ ].
The next line contains an integer representing the knapsack capacity W.


Output Format:

An integer representing the maximum total value in the knapsack which is smaller than or equal to W.


Sample Test Case:

Input: N = 3, W = 4

values[N] = {1,2,3}

weight[N] = {4,5,1}

Output: 3
